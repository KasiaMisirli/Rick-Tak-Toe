## Click the following link to play: https://kasiamisirli.github.io/Rick-Tak-Toe/.

**Rick-Tac-Toe** is based on Tic Tac Toe game, which is intended for two players only, X (Sheriff hat) and O (Zombie finger), 
who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 Ã— 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, 
vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Mine Rick-Tac-Toe is a game between *Rick Grimes* and *Zombelson Zombekowski* aka. Zombie.
With each move, Rick is placing his hat on the ground and Zombelson Zombekowski is placing fingers as a zombie probably would.
After the winner is announced, user can hit the "Play again" button to start a new game.

### Tools used:
For this project, I have mainly used Flexbox and CSS transformation and animation. 
The logic is built with Javascript.

### Possible additions:
If I had a bit more time, I could add player selector and counting the score.
Also, I could improve GUI by changing the images and add more animation.
